# CircuitSimulatorY1
First Year Project by Hannah Shewan, Kia Popat and Joachim Sand

We created a circuit simulator in C++ that performs AC frequency analysis from a text file that describes a circuit

When evaluating our solution to the industry standard circuit simulator (LTSpice), we identified cases in which it converges to a solution whilst LTSpice did not, including in circuits with multiple non-linear devices
